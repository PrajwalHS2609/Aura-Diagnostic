            Doppler scans are crucial in detecting vascular diseases such as
            deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and peripheral artery disease (PAD). The
            Doppler scan in Rajajinagar, Bangalore can help identify blockages

          <p>
            In pregnancy, a Doppler scan in Rajajinagar, Bangalore can be used
            to monitor the blood flow between the placenta and the fetus,
            ensuring that the baby is receiving adequate nutrients and oxygen.
            This scan is especially important in high-risk pregnancies where
            there might be concerns about fetal growth or well-being.
          </p>
        </ul>
        <ul>

          <h6>3. Heart Conditions:</h6>
          <p>
            For patients with suspected heart conditions, the Doppler scan in
            Rajajinagar, Bangalore is invaluable in detecting abnormal blood
            flow, valve dysfunction, and other cardiovascular issues. It
            provides real-time images that can guide treatment decisions,
            helping physicians address heart problems more effectively.
          </p>

            Detecting blood clots early is critical in preventing
            life-threatening conditions like pulmonary embolism. A Doppler scan
            in Rajajinagar, Bangalore can quickly identify clots in the legs,
            arms, or other parts of the body, allowing for prompt medical
            intervention.
