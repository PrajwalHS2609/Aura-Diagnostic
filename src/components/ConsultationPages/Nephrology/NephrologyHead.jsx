      <p id="expect">
        Nephrology is a specialized branch of medicine that focuses on the
        diagnosis, treatment, and management of kidney-related conditions. At
        Aura Diagnostics, nephrology services help evaluate kidney function and
        identify disorders such as chronic kidney disease, kidney infections,
        kidney stones, electrolyte imbalances, and high blood pressure related
        to kidney health. Nephrologists also manage conditions affecting fluid
        balance and waste removal in the body. Using advanced diagnostic tests
        including blood tests, urine analysis, ultrasound, and other imaging
        studies, nephrology plays a key role in early detection and monitoring
        of kidney problems. Timely nephrology evaluation supports effective
        treatment, slows disease progression, and helps maintain overall health
        and quality of life.
