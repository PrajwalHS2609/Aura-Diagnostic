      <h2>What to Expect During a Nephrology Consultation?</h2>

      <p>
        During a nephrology consultation at Aura Diagnostics, patients can
        expect a detailed and supportive assessment of kidney health. The
        consultation typically begins with a review of your medical history,
        including existing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or
        urinary issues, as these can directly affect kidney function. The
        nephrologist will ask about symptoms like swelling, fatigue, changes in
        urination, or flank pain, and review any previous test reports.
      </p>
      <p>
        A physical examination is performed, which may include checking blood
        pressure, assessing swelling in the legs or face, and evaluating overall
        health. Based on the findings, the doctor may recommend diagnostic tests
        such as blood tests, urine analysis, ultrasound, or other imaging
        studies. The nephrologist will explain the test results clearly, discuss
        the diagnosis, and suggest a personalized treatment or management plan.
        At Aura Diagnostics, the focus is on early detection, accurate
        diagnosis, and guiding patients toward better long-term kidney health.
