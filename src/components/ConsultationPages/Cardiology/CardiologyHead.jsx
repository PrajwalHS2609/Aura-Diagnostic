      <p id="expect">
        Cardiology is a specialized branch of medicine that focuses on the
        diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of heart and blood vessel–related
        conditions. At Aura Diagnostics, cardiology services play a vital role
        in identifying heart problems early and supporting effective treatment
        planning. Cardiology covers a wide range of conditions such as high
        blood pressure, coronary artery disease, heart rhythm disorders, heart
        failure, and congenital heart defects. Using advanced diagnostic tests
        like ECG, echocardiography, stress tests, and cardiac imaging,
        cardiologists evaluate heart function and overall cardiovascular health.
        Early detection through cardiology helps prevent serious complications
        and supports timely medical care for a healthier heart and improved
        quality of life.
