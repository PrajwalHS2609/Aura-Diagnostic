      <h2>What to Expect During a Cardiology Consultation?</h2>
      <p>
        During a cardiology consultation at Aura Diagnostics, patients can
        expect a thorough and reassuring evaluation of their heart health. The
        consultation usually begins with a detailed discussion of your medical
        history, lifestyle habits, family history of heart disease, and any
        symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or
        palpitations. The cardiologist will then perform a physical examination,
        including checking blood pressure, heart rate, and listening to heart
        sounds.

      <p>
        Based on the initial assessment, the doctor may recommend diagnostic
        tests such as an ECG, echocardiogram, stress test, or blood
        investigations to better understand heart function. Each test is
        explained clearly, ensuring patients feel comfortable and informed. The
        cardiologist will review the results, discuss findings, and suggest a
        personalized treatment or lifestyle plan. At Aura Diagnostics, the goal
        is to provide clear guidance, early detection, and compassionate care to
        support long-term heart health.
