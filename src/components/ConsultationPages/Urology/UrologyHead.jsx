      <h2>What is a Urology</h2>
      <p id="expect">
        Urology is a medical specialty focused on the diagnosis, treatment, and
        management of conditions affecting the urinary tract and the male
        reproductive system. At Aura Diagnostics, urology services help evaluate
        disorders related to the kidneys, bladder, ureters, urethra, and
        prostate. Common urological conditions include urinary tract infections,
        kidney stones, prostate enlargement, incontinence, and male fertility
        issues. Urologists also address conditions related to urinary control
        and sexual health. Using advanced diagnostic tests such as ultrasound,
        uroflowmetry, urine analysis, and imaging studies, urology plays an
        important role in early detection and effective treatment planning.
        Timely urological evaluation supports better urinary health, improved
        comfort, and enhanced quality of life for patients.
