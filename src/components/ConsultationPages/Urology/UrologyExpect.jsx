      <h2>What to Expect During a Urology Consultation?</h2>
      <p>
        During a urology consultation at Aura Diagnostics, patients can expect a
        confidential, respectful, and thorough evaluation of urinary and
        reproductive health concerns. The consultation usually begins with a
        detailed discussion of your medical history, current symptoms, and
        lifestyle habits. The urologist may ask about issues such as urinary
        frequency, pain during urination, blood in urine, kidney stones,
        prostate symptoms, or male reproductive concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        A physical examination may be conducted, depending on the condition
        being evaluated, to assess overall urological health. Based on the
        initial assessment, the doctor may recommend diagnostic tests such as
        urine analysis, ultrasound, uroflowmetry, or other imaging studies. Each
        test is clearly explained to ensure patient comfort and understanding.
        After reviewing the results, the urologist will discuss the findings and
        suggest an appropriate treatment or management plan. At Aura
        Diagnostics, the focus is on accurate diagnosis, patient privacy, and
        providing clear guidance for long-term urological health.
