      <h3>What is an ECHO Test?</h3>
      <p>
        An ECHO Test in Bangalore is a non-invasive diagnostic test
        that uses high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound) to create live images
        of the heart. These images help cardiologists assess the heart's size,
        shape, and movement, as well as the function of its chambers and valves.

        Preparing for an ECHO Test in Bangalore is simple, and most
        patients do not need to take any special steps. However, for certain

        procedure usually takes about 30-60 minutes, depending on the type of
