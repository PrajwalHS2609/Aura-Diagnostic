      <h3>What is an ECG Test?</h3>
      <p>
        The ECG Test in Bangalore, Bangalore is a non-invasive procedure that
        records the electrical signals in your heart. These signals trigger your
        heart to beat and are responsible for coordinating the movement of blood
        through your body. By examining the electrical impulses, doctors can
        assess whether the heart is beating too fast, too slow, or irregularly.
