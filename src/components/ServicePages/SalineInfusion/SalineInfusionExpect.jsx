        What to Expect During a Saline Infusion Sonohystersalphingography?
      </h2>
      <p>
        During a Saline Infusion Sonohysterosalpingography (SIS/SSG), you can
        expect a smooth and carefully monitored procedure designed to provide
        detailed insights into your uterine and tubal health. The process begins
        with a preliminary transvaginal ultrasound to assess baseline
        conditions. You will then be asked to lie comfortably as a thin, sterile
        catheter is gently inserted through the cervix. Once in place, sterile
        saline is slowly infused into the uterine cavity, helping expand it to
        create clearer ultrasound images of the uterus and fallopian tubes.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the saline flows in, the specialist will use transvaginal ultrasound
        imaging to observe the uterine lining, check for structural
        abnormalities, and assess whether the fallopian tubes are open. You may
        feel mild cramping or slight discomfort similar to menstrual pain, but
        it usually subsides quickly. The entire procedure typically lasts 20–30
        minutes, and you can resume normal activities shortly afterward. SIS is
        a safe, minimally invasive test that provides highly valuable diagnostic
        information, especially for fertility evaluation and uterine health
        assessment.
