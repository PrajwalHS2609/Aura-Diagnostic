      <h2>What is a Saline Infusion Sonohystersalphingography?</h2>
      <p id="expect">
        Saline Infusion Sonohysterosalpingography (SIS or SSG) is an advanced
        ultrasound-based procedure used to evaluate the uterus and fallopian
        tubes with greater clarity. During this test, sterile saline is gently
        introduced into the uterine cavity, allowing ultrasound imaging to
        clearly outline the inner walls of the uterus and assess any
        abnormalities such as polyps, fibroids, adhesions, or structural issues.
        SIS is also used to check tubal patency, which is essential for
        evaluating fertility concerns. It is a minimally invasive, safe, and
        highly informative diagnostic tool often recommended for women
        experiencing infertility, recurrent miscarriages, or abnormal uterine
        bleeding.
