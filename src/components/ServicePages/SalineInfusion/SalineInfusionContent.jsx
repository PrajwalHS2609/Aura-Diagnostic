            used in women’s reproductive health evaluation. It provides a
            detailed assessment of the uterus and fallopian tubes, making it
            highly valuable for women experiencing infertility, irregular
            bleeding, or suspected uterine abnormalities. As demand for
            fertility and gynecological imaging increases, many women now prefer
            the sonohysterography in Girinagar due to its accuracy, convenience,
            and real-time visualization.

          <h2>What Is the SIS Test?</h2>
          <p>
            The SIS procedure involves gently infusing sterile saline into the
            uterine cavity during an ultrasound scan. This technique enhances
            visibility of the endometrium, enabling clinicians to detect polyps,
            fibroids, adhesions, and other structural concerns. The{" "}

            using SIS helps in identifying abnormalities that may not be visible
            through a standard transvaginal ultrasound. This makes it a
            preferred first-line diagnostic tool for reproductive specialists
            and gynecologists.

              <h2>Why SIS Is Important in Infertility Evaluation</h2>
              <p>
                For women planning pregnancy or undergoing fertility treatment,
                the SIS test is crucial. It allows a non-invasive assessment of
                the fallopian tubes and uterine lining, which directly impact
                conception. Many women opt for an infertility SIS test in
                Girinagar to detect possible barriers to pregnancy at an early
                stage. When combined with a pelvic ultrasound, SIS can provide
                essential insights into tubal patency, endometrial health, and
                structural integrity of the uterus.

                , performed through SIS, helps identify whether the tubes are
                open or blocked. Blocked fallopian tubes are a common cause of
                infertility, and early detection helps women explore appropriate
                fertility treatments.

              <h2>How Sonohysterography Works</h2>
              <p>
                The process of sonohysterography in Girinagar is simple,
                outpatient-based, and minimally uncomfortable. After placing a
                speculum, a thin catheter is inserted into the uterus. As saline
                flows into the cavity, ultrasound images are taken to study the
                uterine walls and fallopian tubes. The saline acts as a natural
                contrast agent, improving image clarity and helping detect even
                minute irregularities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because of its precision and safety profile, SIS is recommended
                for women who experience:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li> Recurrent miscarriages</li>
                <li> Unexplained infertility</li>
                <li> Abnormal uterine bleeding</li>
                <li> Suspected fibroids or polyps</li>
                <li> Pelvic pain</li>
                <li> Irregular menstrual cycles</li>

              <h2>Conditions Detected Through SIS</h2>
              <p>
                Many gynecological conditions can be identified quickly and
                accurately with SIS, making it a superior diagnostic tool
                compared to traditional ultrasound alone. Common findings
                include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li> Endometrial polyps</li>

              <h2>Benefits of SIS Over Other Diagnostic Procedures</h2>
              <p>
                Women across Girinagar increasingly prefer SIS because of its
                advantages:
              </p>

              <h3>1. Non-invasive and Safe</h3>
              <p>
                Unlike hysteroscopy or laparoscopic evaluation, SIS requires no
                anesthesia and involves no surgical intervention.
              </p>
              <h3>2. High Diagnostic Accuracy</h3>
              <p>
                The enhanced imaging from the uterus cavity scan in Girinagar
                makes SIS more reliable than standard ultrasound for detecting
                intrauterine abnormalities.
              </p>
              <h3>3. Quick Recovery & Minimal Discomfort</h3>

              <p>
                Most women resume normal activities immediately after the
                procedure.
              </p>
              <h3>4. Cost-Effective</h3>
              <p>
                Compared to more invasive methods, SIS is affordable while still
                providing comprehensive insights.
              </p>
              <h3>5. Essential for Fertility Treatment Planning</h3>
