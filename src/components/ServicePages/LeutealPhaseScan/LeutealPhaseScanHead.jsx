      <h2>What is a Leuteal Phase Scan?</h2>
      <p id="expect">
        A Luteal Phase Scan is an ultrasound performed during the second half of
        a woman’s menstrual cycle, typically after ovulation. Its main purpose
        is to assess the condition of the uterus and ovaries during the luteal
        phase, when the body prepares for possible implantation. This scan
        evaluates the thickness and pattern of the endometrium (uterine lining),
        checks for the presence of a corpus luteum, and monitors ovarian
        activity. It helps fertility specialists understand whether the uterine
        environment is supportive for conception. At Aura Diagnostics, a Luteal
        Phase Scan provides essential insights for women undergoing fertility
        evaluations or treatments like IVF, IUI, or natural cycle monitoring.
