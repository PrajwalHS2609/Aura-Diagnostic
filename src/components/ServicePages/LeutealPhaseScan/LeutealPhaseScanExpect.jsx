      <h2>What to Expect During a Leuteal Phase Scan?</h2>

      <p>
        During a Luteal Phase Scan at Aura Diagnostics, you can expect a smooth,
        comfortable, and well-guided experience focused on assessing your
        reproductive health after ovulation. When you arrive, our specialist
        will explain the purpose of the scan and address any questions you may
        have. The procedure is usually performed transvaginally because it
        provides the clearest and most accurate view of the uterus and ovaries
        during this phase of your cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the scan, the sonographer will evaluate the endometrium (uterine
        lining) to check its thickness, texture, and blood flow—key indicators
        of how well the uterus is prepared for implantation. The scan also
        assesses the corpus luteum, the structure that forms after ovulation and
        produces progesterone. Its size, appearance, and blood flow are
        important for supporting early pregnancy. The ovaries are also examined
        for any post-ovulatory changes or abnormalities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scan typically takes about 10–15 minutes and is painless, though you
        may feel mild pressure. Once completed, your doctor will review the
        findings with you, discuss whether your luteal phase is progressing
        normally, and suggest any necessary treatment options. Aura Diagnostics
        ensures compassionate care, clarity, and accuracy at every step.
