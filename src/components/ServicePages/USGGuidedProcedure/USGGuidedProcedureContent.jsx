          <h2>What Are Ultrasound-Guided Procedures?</h2>
          <p>
            Ultrasound guidance uses real-time imaging to help radiologists or
            clinicians navigate instruments such as needles, catheters, or
            aspiration tools directly to the target area. This method
            significantly enhances the accuracy of diagnostic tests and
            therapeutic treatments. Whether it is a biopsy, fluid aspiration, or
            cyst drainage,{" "}

            ensures improved outcomes and patient safety.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike blind procedures, which rely solely on physical examination
            or anatomical assumptions, ultrasound-guided methods visualize
            internal structures immediately. This helps in reducing
            complications, minimizing trauma to surrounding tissues, and
            increasing diagnostic accuracy.

                diagnose conditions such as tumors, swellings, nodules, or
                infections. The ultrasound imaging helps the specialist locate
                the exact area and insert the biopsy needle with precision. This
                procedure is frequently used for breast lumps, thyroid nodules,
                lymph nodes, liver lesions, and abdominal masses.

                Biopsies performed under ultrasound guidance are less painful,
                quick, and highly reliable. They also help avoid unnecessary
                surgeries by offering early, accurate diagnostic information.
