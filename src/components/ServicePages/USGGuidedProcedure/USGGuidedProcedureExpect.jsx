      <h2>What to expect when getting an Ultrasound</h2>
      <p>
        A Sonographer utilises a hand-held scanner, called a transducer to
        perform an ultrasound. High-frequency sound waves are sent into your
        body, and their echoes are converted into electrical impulses to create
        images on a screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the scan, the sonographer will apply a gel to your skin in the
        examined area. The sonographer moves the transducer on the gel, pressing
        gently if necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultrasound scans take 20-60 minutes and are performed by specially
        trained professionals. There are no after-effects, and you can resume
        your normal activities afterwards.
