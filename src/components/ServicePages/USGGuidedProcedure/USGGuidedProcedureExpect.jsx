      <h2>What to Expect During a USG-Guided Procedure?</h2>
      <p>
        When you undergo a USG Guided Procedure at Aura Diagnostics, the process
        is smooth, safe, and carefully monitored. First, the radiologist will
        explain the procedure and position you comfortably. A warm ultrasound
        gel is applied, and the ultrasound probe helps visualize the exact
        internal area in real time. Using this live guidance, the doctor gently
        inserts a fine needle or instrument with high precision, ensuring
        minimal discomfort and maximum accuracy.
