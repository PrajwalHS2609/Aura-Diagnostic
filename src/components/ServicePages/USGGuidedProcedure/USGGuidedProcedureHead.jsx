      <h2>What is a USG Guided Procedure? </h2>
      <p>
        {" "}
        A USG (Ultrasound-Guided) Procedure is a minimally invasive technique in
        which ultrasound imaging is used in real time to accurately guide
        needles or instruments to a specific area inside the body. This ensures
        precise targeting, reduces discomfort, and improves the safety and
        success of the procedure.
      </p>

        At Aura Diagnostics, USG-guided techniques are commonly used for fluid
        aspirations, injections, biopsies, cyst drainage, and targeted
        therapeutic procedures. The live ultrasound display helps the
        radiologist avoid surrounding organs, blood vessels, and nerves, making
        the process highly accurate and patient-safe.
