        {" "}
        Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an advanced diagnostic tool that
        captures detailed images of your body’s internal structures. It helps
        identify issues within soft tissues and can be crucial for planning
        specific treatments.
      </p>

        When you undergo an MRI at St Vincent’s Radiology, you’ll typically lie
        on a comfortable table that slides into a tunnel-like scanner. This
        state-of-the-art device uses powerful magnetic fields and radio waves to
        generate signals from your body. These signals are received by a radio
        antenna and processed by a computer to create high-resolution images.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key benefits of MRI scans include producing precise, detailed images
        with the absence of x-ray radiation. The expert staff and cutting-edge
        technology ensure a high standard of care.
