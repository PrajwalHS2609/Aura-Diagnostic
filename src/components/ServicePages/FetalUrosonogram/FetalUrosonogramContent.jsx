            Pregnancy ultrasounds play a vital role in monitoring the healthy
            development of a baby’s organs before birth. Among these
            assessments, a Fetal Urosonogram Test is a specialized ultrasound

            A fetal urosonogram focuses on the kidneys, urinary bladder, and
            urinary tract, helping doctors identify potential abnormalities
            early in pregnancy. This test is often recommended as part of
            advanced fetal evaluation when detailed assessment of the urinary
            system is required.

          <h2>What Is a Fetal Urosonogram Test?</h2>
          <p>
            A fetal urosonogram is a targeted prenatal ultrasound examination
            that evaluates the structure and function of the fetal urinary
            system. Using high-resolution imaging, the scan assesses how the
            kidneys form, how urine flows, and whether the bladder fills and
            empties normally.

            A fetal renal scan in Girinagar helps detect conditions such as
            kidney dilation, urinary tract obstruction, or developmental
            variations, enabling early medical planning and follow-up.
