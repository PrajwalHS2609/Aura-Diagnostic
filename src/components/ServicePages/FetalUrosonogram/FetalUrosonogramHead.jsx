      <h2>What is a Fetal Urosonogram?</h2>
      <p id="expect">
        A Fetal Urosonogram is a specialized ultrasound focused on examining the
        baby’s urinary system during pregnancy. This scan provides detailed
        images of the fetal kidneys, bladder, ureters, and surrounding
        structures to detect any abnormalities or developmental concerns. It is
        often recommended when routine scans show signs of kidney dilation,
        reduced amniotic fluid, or other urinary tract issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fetal urosonogram helps doctors assess kidney function, bladder
        filling and emptying patterns, and overall urinary system health. Early
        detection allows timely monitoring and better planning for treatment
        after birth. At Aura Diagnostics, this scan is performed using
        high-resolution imaging technology to ensure accurate, clear, and
        reliable results for expectant parents.
