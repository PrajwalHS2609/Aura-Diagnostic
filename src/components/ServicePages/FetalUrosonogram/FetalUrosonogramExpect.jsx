      <h2>What to Expect During a Fetal Urosonogram?</h2>
      <p>
        {" "}
        During a Fetal Urosonogram at Aura Diagnostics, you can expect a
        detailed and focused evaluation of your baby’s developing urinary
        system. The session begins with a brief discussion about your pregnancy
        history, previous scan findings, and any concerns your doctor may have
        noted. You will then be asked to lie comfortably on the ultrasound
        table, and a warm gel will be applied to your abdomen to help produce
        clear imaging.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using high-resolution ultrasound equipment, the sonographer examines
        your baby’s kidneys, bladder, ureters, and surrounding structures. They
        will carefully observe bladder size, kidney shape, urine flow, and
        bladder filling and emptying cycles. If needed, you may be asked to wait
        a few minutes to allow the baby’s bladder to refill for a more accurate
        assessment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scan is completely safe, painless, and usually lasts 20–30 minutes,
        depending on the baby’s position and clarity of visuals. You may see
        your baby’s movements on the screen as the scan progresses.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Aura Diagnostics, every fetal urosonogram is interpreted by expert
        radiologists who ensure precise measurements and clear reporting,
        helping your obstetrician plan appropriate follow-up and care for your
        baby’s wellbeing.
