      <h2>What is a Carotid Doppler?</h2>
      <p id="expect">
        A Carotid Doppler is a specialized ultrasound test used to evaluate the
        carotid arteries, the major blood vessels on both sides of the neck that
        supply oxygen-rich blood to the brain. This non-invasive scan uses sound
        waves to measure blood flow and detect any narrowing, blockages, or
        plaque buildup in the arteries. Early detection of these issues is
        crucial because reduced blood flow can increase the risk of stroke or
        other cardiovascular problems. At Aura Diagnostics, a Carotid Doppler
        provides accurate, real-time insights into vascular health, helping
        doctors diagnose conditions early and plan effective treatment or
        preventive care.
