            A Carotid Doppler Scan in Girinagar, Bangalore plays a crucial role
            in detecting early signs of stroke, reduced blood flow to the brain,
            and narrowing of the carotid arteries. This non-invasive
            ultrasound-based test evaluates the major arteries in the neck that
            supply oxygen-rich blood to the brain. With increasing
            cardiovascular risks due to lifestyle, age, diabetes, thyroid
            disorders, hypertension, and smoking, the demand for{" "}

          <h2>What Is a Carotid Doppler Scan?</h2>
          <p>
            A carotid Doppler scan is an advanced vascular ultrasound that uses
            sound waves to examine the carotid arteries located on both sides of
            the neck. During the test, real-time images and flow measurements
            are captured to detect abnormalities. Many individuals undergo a
            carotid ultrasound in Girinagar as part of their routine
            cardiovascular evaluation.
          </p>
          <p>
            This test is safe, painless, radiation-free, and highly reliable for
            identifying early arterial changes. Patients with symptoms like
            dizziness, frequent headaches, blurred vision, numbness, or a past
            history of cardiac illness often undergo a{" "}

              <h2>Why is a Carotid Doppler Important?</h2>
              <p>
                Since the carotid arteries supply blood directly to the brain,
                any blockage or narrowing can lead to serious health
                complications. A stroke risk assessment in Girinagar typically
                includes this ultrasound test for early detection.

              <p>
                The test is simple and comfortable. A trained sonographer
                applies a gel on the neck region and moves a handheld transducer
                over the carotid arteries. The device captures live ultrasound
                images that help detect plaque buildup, blockages, or altered
                blood flow.
