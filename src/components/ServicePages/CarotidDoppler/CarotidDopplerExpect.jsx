      <h2>What to Expect During a Carotid Doppler?</h2>
      <p>
        {" "}
        During a Carotid Doppler at Aura Diagnostics, you can expect a smooth,
        non-invasive, and painless procedure designed to assess the blood flow
        in your carotid arteries. When you arrive, our trained technician will
        explain the process and help you feel relaxed. You will be asked to lie
        down comfortably on an examination table, and a gel will be applied to
        the sides of your neck to ensure clear ultrasound transmission.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using a handheld transducer, the sonographer will gently move the device
        along each side of your neck. This allows real-time imaging of the
        carotid arteries and detailed evaluation of blood flow, vessel walls,
        and any plaque buildup or narrowing. You may hear a whooshing sound from
        the Doppler equipment—this is the sound of blood moving through the
        arteries.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire scan usually takes 15–30 minutes and requires no radiation.
        Once the scan is complete, the gel is wiped off, and you can resume
        normal activities immediately. Afterward, your doctor will review the
        images and discuss any findings, such as early signs of blockage or
        reduced blood flow. Aura Diagnostics ensures accuracy, comfort, and
        prompt reporting for every Carotid Doppler scan.
