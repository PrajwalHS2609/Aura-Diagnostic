      <h2>What is a Pregnancy Scan?</h2>
      <p id="expect">
        A pregnancy scan is a safe and painless ultrasound procedure used to
        monitor the health, growth, and development of a baby during pregnancy.
        At Aura Diagnostics, pregnancy scans help expectant mothers understand
        how their baby is progressing at different stages. Using high-resolution
        imaging, the scan checks the baby’s heartbeat, movement, position, and
        overall wellbeing. It also helps identify the gestational age, expected
        due date, placenta location, and any early concerns that may need
        medical attention. Pregnancy scans provide reassurance, important
        medical insights, and support your doctor in offering the right care
        throughout your journey. At Aura Diagnostics, accuracy and comfort are
        always our top priority.
