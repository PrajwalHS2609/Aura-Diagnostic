      <h2>What to Expect During a Pregnancy Scan?</h2>
      <p>
        During a pregnancy scan at Aura Diagnostics, you can expect a
        comfortable, safe, and well-guided experience from start to finish. The
        session begins with a brief discussion where our expert sonographers ask
        about your medical history, pregnancy stage, and any concerns you may
        have. You will then be asked to lie on the ultrasound bed, and a warm
        gel is gently applied to your abdomen to ensure clear imaging.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the scan begins, the sonographer moves the probe over your stomach to
        capture real-time images of your baby. You may see your baby’s
        heartbeat, movements, and growth on the monitor. Depending on the stage
        of pregnancy, the scan may also check your baby’s organ development,
        placenta position, amniotic fluid levels, and estimated due date.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the process, our team explains what you are seeing and
        ensures you feel relaxed and informed. The procedure is painless,
        typically lasts 10–20 minutes, and you can resume normal activities
        immediately afterward. At Aura Diagnostics, our goal is to make every
        pregnancy scan reassuring, clear, and emotionally memorable.
