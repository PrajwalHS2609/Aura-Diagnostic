      <p id="expect">
        Amniocentesis is a specialized prenatal diagnostic procedure used to
        evaluate the health and development of an unborn baby. During this test,
        a small amount of amniotic fluid— which surrounds the fetus inside the
        uterus— is gently extracted using a thin needle under continuous
        ultrasound guidance. This fluid contains fetal cells and important
        biomarkers that help doctors detect chromosomal abnormalities, genetic
        disorders, neural tube defects, and certain infections. Amniocentesis is
        usually recommended between 15–20 weeks of pregnancy, especially when
        screening tests indicate potential risks or when there is a family
        history of genetic conditions. It is a safe, reliable, and highly
        informative test when performed by experts at Aura Diagnostics.
