      <h2>What to Expect During a Amniocentesis?</h2>
      <p>
        During an amniocentesis at Aura Diagnostics, you can expect a carefully
        supervised and comfortable experience guided by highly trained
        specialists. The procedure typically begins with an ultrasound scan to
        determine the exact position of the baby, placenta, and amniotic fluid
        pockets. Once the ideal spot is identified, the abdomen is cleaned with
        an antiseptic solution to maintain complete hygiene. A thin, long needle
        is then gently inserted through the abdomen into the amniotic sac to
        withdraw a small amount of amniotic fluid. Most women feel only mild
        pressure or slight discomfort for a few seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire procedure usually takes about 15–20 minutes. After the sample
        is collected, another quick ultrasound is performed to ensure the baby’s
        well-being. You may be advised to rest for the remainder of the day and
        avoid strenuous activities. The collected fluid is sent for advanced
        laboratory testing to analyze chromosomal, genetic, or developmental
        conditions. Aura Diagnostics ensures clear communication, safety, and
        emotional support throughout the process, helping expectant mothers feel
        confident and informed.
