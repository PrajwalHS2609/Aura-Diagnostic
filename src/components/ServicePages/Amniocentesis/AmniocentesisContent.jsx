          </h1>
          <p>
            An Amniocentesis ultrasound test in Girinagar is an advanced
            prenatal diagnostic procedure recommended when a pregnancy requires
            deeper genetic evaluation. This test involves extracting a small
            amount of amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus to check for
            chromosomal, genetic, or developmental abnormalities. Many parents
            rely on{" "}

            when screening reports suggest a higher risk or when medical history
            indicates the need for further assessment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Amniocentesis is typically performed between 15 and 20 weeks of
            pregnancy, and it offers highly accurate results for detecting
            chromosomal conditions, inherited disorders, and certain structural
            abnormalities. With rising awareness of prenatal genetics, the
            demand for chromosomal abnormality tests in Girinagar has
            significantly increased among expectant families seeking clearer
            insights into fetal health.

          <h2>Why Amniocentesis Is Performed During Pregnancy</h2>
          <p>
            Doctors may recommend an amniocentesis ultrasound in Girinagar for
            various medical reasons. Some of the most common include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Positive or borderline first-trimester screening results</li>
            <li> History of genetic conditions in the family</li>
            <li> Maternal age above 35</li>
            <li> Abnormal ultrasound findings</li>
            <li> Risk of inherited metabolic disorders</li>
            <li> Rh incompatibility monitoring in later pregnancy</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This test is a crucial tool when early ultrasound screening suggests
            the possibility of conditions such as Down syndrome, Edwards
            syndrome, or neural tube defects. With the support of a skilled

              <h2>Role of Ultrasound in Amniocentesis</h2>
              <p>
                Ultrasound guidance plays a vital role in the safety and
                accuracy of the procedure. During the exam, real-time imaging is
                used to identify fetal position, placental placement, and the
                safest pocket of amniotic fluid for sample collection. This
                makes the process more secure and comfortable for the mother.
