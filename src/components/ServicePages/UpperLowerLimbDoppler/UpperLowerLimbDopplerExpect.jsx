      <h2>What to Expect During a Upper and Lower Limb Doppler?</h2>

      <p>
        During an Upper and Lower Limb Doppler at Aura Diagnostics, you can
        expect a simple, painless, and well-guided procedure designed to
        evaluate the blood flow in your arms and legs. When you arrive, our
        trained technician will explain the process and ensure you feel
        comfortable throughout the scan. You will be asked to lie down on an
        examination table, and depending on the area being examined, your arms
        or legs will be positioned to allow clear access to the blood vessels.
      </p>
      <p>
        A warm gel will be applied to your limbs to help transmit ultrasound
        waves effectively. The sonographer will then move a handheld transducer
        over different sections of your arms and legs to capture real-time
        images of the arteries and veins. Using Doppler technology, the machine
        produces waveforms and audible signals that represent the speed and
        direction of blood flow. You may hear a whooshing sound, which is
        completely normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scan usually takes 20–45 minutes, depending on whether one or both
        limbs are being assessed. The procedure is non-invasive and requires no
        recovery time. After the scan, your doctor will review the results to
        identify any blockages, narrowing, or circulation issues. Aura
        Diagnostics ensures accuracy, compassion, and clarity during every Upper
        and Lower Limb Doppler scan.
