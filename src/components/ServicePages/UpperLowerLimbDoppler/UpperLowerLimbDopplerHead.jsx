      <h2>What is a Upper and Lower Limb Doppler?</h2>
      <p id="expect">
        An Upper and Lower Limb Doppler is a non-invasive ultrasound test used
        to evaluate the blood flow in the arteries and veins of the arms and
        legs. This scan helps detect conditions such as peripheral artery
        disease (PAD), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), varicose veins, blockages, or
        narrowing of blood vessels. Doppler technology measures the speed and
        direction of blood flow, providing real-time insights into vascular
        health. It is commonly recommended for patients with leg pain, swelling,
        numbness, diabetes, or circulation problems. At Aura Diagnostics, an
        Upper and Lower Limb Doppler offers accurate assessment to support early
        diagnosis and effective treatment planning.
