          <h1>Upper and Lower Limb Doppler Scan in Girinagar, Bangalore</h1>
          <p>
            Upper and lower limb Doppler scans play a crucial role in assessing
            blood circulation, detecting vascular diseases, and diagnosing
            conditions that affect arteries and veins in the arms and legs. In
            Girinagar, Bangalore, many individuals search for reliable Limb
            Doppler ultrasound in Girinagar to evaluate symptoms like leg pain,
            swelling, numbness, varicose veins, or reduced blood flow. This
            specialized ultrasound test uses high-frequency sound waves to
            examine circulation and identify potential blockages or narrowing in
            major vessels, ensuring early detection and timely treatment.

          <h2>Why Limb Doppler Ultrasound Is Important</h2>
          <p>
            Whether you're experiencing chronic leg discomfort, recovering from
            surgery, or monitoring an existing vascular disorder, a Peripheral
            Doppler scan in Girinagar becomes essential. This test helps
            visualize both arterial and venous blood flow, enabling physicians
            to diagnose issues like peripheral artery disease (PAD), deep vein
            thrombosis (DVT), varicosities, or compromised limb circulation. As
            vascular problems are becoming increasingly common due to sedentary
            lifestyles, diabetes, and high blood pressure, timely evaluation
            with a Vascular Doppler test in Girinagar ensures better long-term
            vascular health.

                Arterial Doppler Test in Girinagar — Detect Blockages Early
              </h2>
              <p>
                The Arterial Doppler test in Girinagar is used to measure blood
                flow in arteries to detect:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li> Arterial stenosis (narrowing)</li>
                <li> Atherosclerotic plaque buildup</li>
                <li> Reduced limb perfusion</li>
                <li> Peripheral artery disease</li>
                <li> Post-surgical arterial complications</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                When patients experience symptoms like leg cramps while walking,
                cold extremities, or non-healing foot ulcers, an arterial
                Doppler scan becomes an immediate requirement. Detecting reduced
                blood supply early helps prevent major vascular complications.
