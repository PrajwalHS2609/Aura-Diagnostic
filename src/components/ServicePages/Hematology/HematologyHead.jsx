      <h2>What is a Hematology Blood Test?</h2>
      <p id="expect">
        A Hematology Blood Test is a medical examination that analyzes the
        components of your blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells,
        hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets. This test helps evaluate overall
        health and detect conditions such as anemia, infections, inflammation,
        bleeding disorders, immune system issues, and certain blood cancers.
        Hematology tests are essential for diagnosing symptoms like fatigue,
        weakness, fever, unusual bleeding, and frequent infections. Doctors also
        use them to monitor ongoing treatments and chronic medical conditions.
        At Aura Diagnostics, hematology testing is performed using advanced
        technology to ensure accurate, reliable, and timely results for
        effective clinical decision-making.
