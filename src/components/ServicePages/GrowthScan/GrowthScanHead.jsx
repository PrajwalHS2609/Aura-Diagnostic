      <h2>What is a Growth Scans with Doppler?</h2>
      <p id="expect">
        A Growth Scan with Doppler is a specialized pregnancy ultrasound
        performed in the second or third trimester to monitor the baby’s growth,
        wellbeing, and blood circulation. The scan measures the baby’s size,
        weight, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and limb length to
        ensure healthy development. The Doppler component evaluates blood flow
        in key vessels such as the umbilical artery, uterine artery, and fetal
        vessels, helping detect issues like restricted growth or reduced oxygen
        supply.
      </p>
      <p>
        This scan is especially important for high-risk pregnancies, mothers
        with medical conditions, or when previous scans indicate growth
        concerns. At Aura Diagnostics, Growth Scans with Doppler are done using
        advanced imaging technology to provide accurate, detailed, and reliable
        assessments of fetal health.
