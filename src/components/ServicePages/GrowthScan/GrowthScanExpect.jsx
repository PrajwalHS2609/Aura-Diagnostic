      <h2>What to Expect During a Growth Scans with Doppler?</h2>
      <p>
        During a Growth Scan with Doppler at Aura Diagnostics, you can expect a
        detailed and reassuring evaluation of your baby’s development and
        overall wellbeing. The appointment begins with a short discussion about
        your pregnancy history, recent scan reports, and any concerns you may
        have. You will then be asked to lie comfortably on the ultrasound table
        while a warm gel is applied to your abdomen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using advanced high-resolution ultrasound equipment, the sonographer
        measures your baby’s head circumference, abdominal circumference, femur
        length, and estimated weight. These measurements help assess whether
        your baby is growing at a healthy rate. The scan also examines amniotic
        fluid levels, placenta position, and fetal movements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Doppler component evaluates blood flow in key vessels such as the
        umbilical artery, uterine artery, and fetal vessels. You may hear
        rhythmic or whooshing sounds during this part—this is the sound of blood
        flow and is completely normal. Doppler findings provide vital insight
        into oxygen and nutrient supply to the baby.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire procedure is painless, non-invasive, and takes around 20–30
        minutes. At Aura Diagnostics, every Growth Scan with Doppler is
        thoroughly reviewed by expert radiologists to ensure accurate results
        and complete peace of mind for expecting parents.
