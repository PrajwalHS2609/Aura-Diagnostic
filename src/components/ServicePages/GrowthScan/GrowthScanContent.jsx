          <p>
            A healthy pregnancy depends on careful and continuous monitoring of
            fetal growth and well-being. One of the most important evaluations
            during the second and third trimesters is a growth scan with
            Doppler, which provides essential insights into fetal development
            and blood circulation. If you are searching for a <a href="https://auradiagnostics.co.in">reliable Growth
            scan near me Girinagar</a>, understanding the role and benefits of this

            A <a href="https://auradiagnostics.co.in">fetal Doppler scan in Girinagar</a> is a specialized ultrasound
            examination that assesses how blood flows between the placenta,
            fetus, and uterus, ensuring that the baby is receiving adequate
            oxygen and nutrients.

          <h2>What Is a Growth Scan with Doppler?</h2>
          <p>
            A growth scan evaluates the size, weight, and development of the
            fetus over time, while the Doppler component measures blood flow in
            specific vessels. Together, these assessments provide a
            comprehensive view of fetal health.
