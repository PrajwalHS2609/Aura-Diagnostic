      <h2>What is a Body Fluid Aspiration?</h2>
      <p id="expect">
        Body Fluid Aspiration is a minimally invasive diagnostic procedure used
        to remove and examine fluid collected in different parts of the body,
        such as the chest (pleural fluid), abdomen (ascitic fluid), joints
        (synovial fluid), or around organs. This procedure helps doctors
        identify infections, inflammation, cancers, bleeding disorders, and
        other underlying medical conditions. Using a sterile needle and syringe,
        the fluid is safely withdrawn and sent for laboratory analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Body Fluid Aspiration is quick, effective, and essential for accurate
        diagnosis and timely treatment planning. At Aura Diagnostics, the
        procedure is performed with expert care, advanced safety standards, and
        precise evaluation for reliable results.
