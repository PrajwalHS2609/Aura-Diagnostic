      <h2>What to Expect During a Body Fluid Aspiration?</h2>
      <p>
        During a Body Fluid Aspiration procedure at Aura Diagnostics, you can
        expect a safe, controlled, and professionally guided experience focused
        on both comfort and diagnostic accuracy. The process begins with a brief
        consultation where the doctor reviews your symptoms, medical history,
        and recent scan or test results to determine the exact location and
        purpose of the aspiration.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will then be positioned comfortably—lying down or seated—depending
        on the area from which the fluid needs to be withdrawn. The skin over
        the site is thoroughly cleaned with antiseptic solution to ensure
        complete sterility. In most cases, a local anesthetic is administered to
        numb the area, minimizing discomfort throughout the procedure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using ultrasound guidance when needed, the doctor gently inserts a
        sterile needle into the fluid-filled space. You may feel mild pressure,
        but the procedure is typically well-tolerated and lasts only a few
        minutes. The collected fluid is then sent to the laboratory for detailed
        analysis to identify infections, inflammation, cancers, or other
        underlying conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the aspiration, a small bandage is applied, and you may be
        monitored briefly before going home. At Aura Diagnostics, patient
        safety, cleanliness, and accurate diagnostic evaluation are top
        priorities at every step.
