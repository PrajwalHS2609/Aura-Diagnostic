      <h2>What is a Tumor Markers Blood Test?</h2>
      <p id="expect">
        A Tumor Markers Blood Test is a specialized diagnostic test
        used to detect specific proteins, antigens, or substances released by
        cancer cells into the bloodstream. These tumor markers help doctors
        evaluate the presence, progression, or treatment response of different
        types of cancers. This test is often recommended for early detection,
        monitoring high-risk patients, or tracking how well cancer therapy is
        working. While tumor markers alone cannot confirm cancer, they play a
        crucial supportive role alongside imaging and clinical evaluations. At
        Aura Diagnostics, this assessment helps provide clearer insights into a
        patient’s overall hematological and oncological health.
