      <h2>What is a 3D Baseline Scan/AFC Scans?</h2>
      <p id="expect">
        A 3D Baseline Scan/AFC (Antral Follicle Count) Scan is an advanced
        ultrasound assessment used to evaluate a woman’s ovarian reserve and
        overall reproductive health. Performed at the beginning of the menstrual
        cycle, this scan uses 3D imaging to measure the number, size, and
        quality of antral follicles present in the ovaries. It helps fertility
        specialists understand egg quantity, predict response to fertility
        treatments, and plan the right course of action for IVF, IUI, or natural
        conception. A 3D Baseline Scan/AFC Scan provides accurate, detailed
        insights into ovarian function, making it an essential step in
        infertility evaluation and treatment planning at Aura Diagnostics.
