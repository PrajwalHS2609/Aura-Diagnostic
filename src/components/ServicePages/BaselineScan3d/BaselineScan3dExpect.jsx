      <h2>What to Expect During a 3D Baseline Scan/AFC Scans?</h2>

      <p>
        A 3D Baseline Scan/AFC (Antral Follicle Count) Scan at Aura Diagnostics
        is a simple, informative, and thoroughly guided procedure designed to
        help assess your reproductive health with precision. When you arrive,
        our expert sonographers will explain each step, ensuring you feel
        comfortable and prepared. The scan is usually performed transvaginally
        during the early days of your menstrual cycle, when the antral follicles
        are most visible and measurable.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the scan, a 3D ultrasound probe gently captures high-resolution
        images of your ovaries, allowing the specialist to count the antral
        follicles and evaluate ovarian volume and structure. The process is
        painless, takes around 10–15 minutes, and provides highly accurate
        insights into your ovarian reserve.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will be able to discuss the scan results with your fertility
        specialist, who will explain what the follicle count means for
        treatments like IVF, IUI, or natural conception planning. This scan is
        crucial in predicting how your body may respond to fertility medications
        and helps create a personalized fertility treatment plan. At Aura
        Diagnostics, your comfort, clarity, and care come first throughout the
        entire 3D Baseline/AFC scan experience.
