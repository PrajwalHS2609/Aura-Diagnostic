      <h2>What to Expect During a FNAC?</h2>
      <p>
        During an FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology) procedure at Aura
        Diagnostics, you can expect a quick, safe, and carefully supervised
        diagnostic experience. The process begins with a short consultation
        where the doctor reviews your medical history, examines the lump or
        swelling, and explains the steps involved. You will be comfortably
        positioned depending on the area being tested.
      </p>
      <p>
        The skin over the site is cleaned thoroughly to maintain hygiene. In
        most cases, anesthesia is not required, as FNAC uses an extremely fine
        needle that causes only minimal discomfort. However, if the area is
        sensitive, a local anesthetic may be applied for added comfort.
      </p>
      <p>
        The doctor then inserts the fine needle into the targeted area to gently
        aspirate (draw out) a small sample of cells. You may feel mild pressure,
        but the procedure is generally painless and lasts only a few minutes.
        Once the sample is collected, a small dressing is applied to the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the procedure, you can resume normal activities almost
        immediately, with only mild soreness possible for a short time. At Aura
        Diagnostics, your sample is examined by expert cytologists, ensuring
        accurate and timely results to guide further treatment or medical
        decisions.
