      <p id="expect">
        FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology) is a minimally invasive
        diagnostic procedure used to examine lumps, swellings, or abnormal
        tissue growths in the body. During FNAC, a very thin, fine needle is
        used to withdraw a small sample of cells from the suspicious area—such
        as the breast, thyroid, lymph nodes, or soft tissues. These cells are
        then analyzed under a microscope to detect infections, inflammation,
        benign growths, or early signs of cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
        FNAC is quick, safe, and usually painless, making it a preferred
        first-line investigative test. At Aura Diagnostics, FNAC is performed by
        skilled specialists to ensure accurate diagnosis and timely medical
        guidance.
