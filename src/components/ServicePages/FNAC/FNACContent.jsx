          <h2>What Is an FNAC Test and Why Is It Important?</h2>
          <p>
            FNAC is a diagnostic method where a thin, fine needle is inserted
            into the lump to extract a small sample of cells. These cells are
            then examined under a microscope by a cytopathologist to determine
            whether the abnormality is benign, malignant, or infection-related.
            Because of its simplicity and fast turnaround time, FNAC is
            preferred over surgical biopsies for many preliminary diagnoses.
          </p>

            Patients often look for the <a href="https://auradiagnostics.co.in/advanced-usg-test-in-girinagar-bangalore">best FNAC center in Girinagar</a> to ensure
            the highest precision because an accurate cytology report plays a
            critical role in planning the right medical or surgical treatment.
            FNAC is commonly used for evaluating thyroid nodules, breast lumps,
            lymph node enlargements, and soft tissue swellings across various
            age groups.

              <h2>Thyroid FNAC in Girinagar – Essential for Thyroid Nodules</h2>
              <p>
                Thyroid swellings have become increasingly common, often
                detected during routine health checks or ultrasound
                examinations. A <a href="https://auradiagnostics.co.in/advanced-usg-test-in-girinagar-bangalore">Thyroid FNAC in Girinagar</a> helps determine
                whether a nodule is non-cancerous, suspicious, or malignant. The
                FNAC report guides endocrinologists in choosing the next
                step—monitoring the nodule, medical treatment, or surgery. It is
                a straightforward test and typically takes only a few minutes.

              <h2>Breast FNAC Test in Girinagar – Early Detection Matters</h2>
              <p>
                Breast lumps can arise due to hormonal changes, infections,
                fibroadenomas, or in rare cases, cancers. A breast FNAC test in
                Girinagar provides clarity by differentiating between benign and
                malignant lumps. Because early diagnosis greatly improves
                treatment outcomes, breast FNAC is one of the most crucial
                investigations for women's health. The procedure is minimally
                painful and provides results quickly, helping remove uncertainty
                and anxiety.

                When patients experience persistent swelling in the neck,
                armpits, groin, or other parts of the body, doctors often
                recommend a <a href="https://auradiagnostics.co.in/usg-guided-procedure-in-girinagar-bangalore">lymph node FNAC in Girinagar</a> to check for infections
                like tuberculosis, viral illnesses, inflammatory conditions, or

                informative and prevents unnecessary surgeries by offering early
                diagnostic insight.

              <p>
                Some lumps are too small or too deep to locate manually. For
