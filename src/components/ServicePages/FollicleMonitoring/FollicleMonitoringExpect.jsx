      <h2>What to Expect During a 3D Follicle Monitoring With Doppler?</h2>

      <p>
        During a 3D Follicle Monitoring with Doppler scan at Aura Diagnostics,
        you can expect a smooth, detailed, and well-explained evaluation of your
        follicular development. The procedure is typically performed
        transvaginally, as this method offers the highest accuracy and clarity.
        Once you arrive, our expert sonographer will guide you through each
        step, ensuring you feel relaxed and informed throughout the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the scan, a 3D ultrasound probe captures high-resolution images
        of your ovaries, allowing the specialist to assess the size, shape, and
        number of developing follicles. The Doppler feature measures blood flow
        around each follicle, which helps determine follicular health and
        maturity—an essential factor for predicting successful ovulation or
        timing fertility treatments.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scan usually takes 10–20 minutes and is painless, though you may
        experience mild pressure. After the scan, your doctor will discuss the
        results, including follicle size progression, blood flow patterns, and
        how close you are to ovulation. This valuable information helps tailor
        treatments like IVF, IUI, or ovulation induction to maximize your
        chances of conception. Aura Diagnostics ensures accuracy, comfort, and
        compassionate care at every step.
