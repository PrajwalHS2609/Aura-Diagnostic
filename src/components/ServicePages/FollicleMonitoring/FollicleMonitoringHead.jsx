      <h2>What is a 3D Follicle Monitoring With Doppler?</h2>
      <p id="expect">
        3D Follicle Monitoring with Doppler is an advanced ultrasound technique
        used to track the growth, size, and health of ovarian follicles during a
        woman’s menstrual cycle or fertility treatment. This scan provides a
        detailed 3D view of developing follicles along with Doppler imaging,
        which measures blood flow around them. The combination helps assess
        follicular maturity, ovulation timing, and the likelihood of successful
        conception. It is especially useful during IVF, IUI, and ovulation
        induction cycles. At Aura Diagnostics, this technology offers precise,
        real-time insights to guide fertility specialists in planning the most
        effective treatment pathway for each patient.
