      <h2>What is a Liver Elastography?</h2>
      <p id="expect">
        Liver Elastography is an advanced, non-invasive ultrasound technique
        used to measure the stiffness and elasticity of liver tissue. It helps
        assess liver health by identifying conditions such as fibrosis,
        cirrhosis, fatty liver, and chronic liver disease without the need for
        biopsy. The scan works by sending sound waves into the liver and
        calculating how quickly they travel—stiffer liver tissue indicates
        potential damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Liver elastography is safe, painless, and provides accurate, real-time
        results that help doctors diagnose disease severity and monitor
        treatment progress. At Aura Diagnostics, this technology is performed
        using high-precision equipment to ensure reliable and early detection of
        liver-related conditions.
