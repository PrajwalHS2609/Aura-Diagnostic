      <h2>What to Expect During a Liver Elastography?</h2>
      <p>
        During a Liver Elastography scan at Aura Diagnostics, you can expect a
        smooth, quick, and completely non-invasive procedure designed to assess
        your liver health with high accuracy. The appointment begins with a
        brief discussion about your medical history, current symptoms, and any
        previous liver-related reports. You will then be asked to lie
        comfortably on your back, usually with your right arm raised to allow
        better access to the liver area.
      </p>
      <p>
        A small amount of gel is applied to your upper abdomen, and the
        sonographer places a specialized ultrasound probe over the liver. The
        device sends gentle sound waves into the liver tissue and measures how
        fast they return. This helps determine liver stiffness—an important
        indicator of conditions like fibrosis, fatty liver, or early-stage
        cirrhosis.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may feel a slight vibration or light pressure, but the scan is
        painless and typically takes 10–20 minutes. No sedation or recovery time
        is needed, and you can resume normal activities immediately after the
        procedure.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Aura Diagnostics, our expert radiologists analyze the results
        thoroughly, ensuring accurate diagnosis and providing your physician
        with essential information for effective treatment planning and
        long-term liver care.
