      <h2>What is a Hematology Biochemistry Blood Test?</h2>
      <p id="expect">
        A Hematology Biochemistry Blood Test is a combined diagnostic evaluation
        that examines both your blood cells and the chemical components
        circulating in your bloodstream. Hematology focuses on red blood cells,
        white blood cells, platelets, hemoglobin, and overall blood health,
        while biochemistry measures essential parameters like liver function,
        kidney function, blood sugar, electrolytes, cholesterol, enzymes, and
        proteins. Together, these tests provide a comprehensive picture of your
        body’s internal functions, helping doctors detect infections, anemia,
        metabolic disorders, hormonal imbalances, organ-related issues, and
        chronic conditions at an early stage. It is a routine yet crucial test
        to monitor overall health and guide accurate medical treatment.
