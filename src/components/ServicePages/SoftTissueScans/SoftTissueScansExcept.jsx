      <h2>What to Expect During a Soft Tissue Scans?</h2>
      <p>
        During a Soft Tissue Scan at Aura Diagnostics, you can expect a smooth,
        comfortable, and highly detailed examination of the area where you are
        experiencing pain, swelling, or a lump. The process begins with a short
        discussion where the sonographer asks about your symptoms, medical
        history, and any recent injuries or surgeries. This helps ensure the
        scan focuses on the exact region of concern.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will be asked to lie comfortably on the examination table, and a
        warm, water-based gel will be applied to the skin. This gel enhances the
        clarity of the ultrasound images. Using a high-frequency probe, the
        sonographer gently moves the device over the area to capture real-time
        visuals of muscles, ligaments, fat layers, fluid pockets, cysts, or any
        abnormal tissue formations.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may be asked to change your position slightly or move the affected
        limb gently to help assess the tissue’s response during motion. The scan
        is non-invasive, painless, and typically takes between 15–25 minutes.
        Once completed, the gel is wiped off, and you can resume your routine
        immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Aura Diagnostics, every Soft Tissue Scan is reviewed by skilled
        radiologists to deliver accurate findings and reliable diagnostic
        support.
