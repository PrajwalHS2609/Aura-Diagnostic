        A Soft Tissue Scan is a specialized ultrasound used to examine the
        body’s soft tissues, including muscles, tendons, ligaments, fat layers,
        and subcutaneous structures. This non-invasive and radiation-free scan
        helps detect conditions such as lumps, cysts, infections, inflammations,
        fluid collections, and soft tissue injuries. It provides real-time
        imaging, allowing doctors to observe movement and assess abnormalities
        with high accuracy. Soft Tissue Scans are commonly recommended for
        swelling, pain, unexplained masses, or post-injury evaluation. At Aura
        Diagnostics, advanced ultrasound technology and expert radiologists
        ensure precise imaging, early detection, and accurate diagnosis for
        effective treatment planning.
