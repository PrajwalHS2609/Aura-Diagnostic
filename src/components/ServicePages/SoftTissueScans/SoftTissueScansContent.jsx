          <h2>What Is a Soft Tissue Ultrasound?</h2>
          <p>
            A soft tissue ultrasound is a high-resolution imaging procedure that
            captures detailed visuals of muscles, tendons, ligaments, and
            connective tissues. Since it does not involve radiation, it is safe
            for people of all ages, including athletes, adults, and elderly
            patients. Many individuals prefer a <a href="https://auradiagnostics.co.in/soft-tissue-scans-in-girinagar-bangalore">soft tissue ultrasound in
