      <h2>What to Expect During a Fatty Liver Quantification?</h2>
      <p>
        {" "}
        During a Fatty Liver Quantification scan at Aura Diagnostics, you can
        expect a smooth, comfortable, and highly accurate evaluation of your
        liver health. The appointment starts with a brief discussion about your
        medical history, lifestyle habits, current symptoms, and any previous
        liver-related reports. You will then be asked to lie comfortably on your
        back, usually with your right arm raised to provide clear access to the
        liver area.
      </p>
      <p>
        A small amount of ultrasound gel is applied to your upper abdomen, and
        the sonographer uses a specialized probe designed for liver fat
        measurement. This advanced device sends sound waves into the liver and
        calculates how they are absorbed or reflected. These readings help
        determine the level of fat accumulation and generate a precise numerical
        score indicating the grade of fatty liver.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might feel mild pressure as the probe moves across your abdomen, but
        the process is painless and non-invasive. The scan typically takes 10–20
        minutes, and you can resume normal activities immediately afterward.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Aura Diagnostics, every fatty liver quantification scan is analyzed
        by experienced radiologists, ensuring accurate results that help your
        doctor plan effective treatment, lifestyle modifications, or follow-up
        care for long-term liver health.
