      <h2>What is a Fatty Liver Quantification?</h2>
      <p id="expect">
        Fatty Liver Quantification is an advanced, non-invasive ultrasound-based
        assessment used to measure the amount of fat deposited in the liver.
        This scan helps accurately detect and grade fatty liver disease (hepatic
        steatosis), a condition often linked to lifestyle factors, obesity,
        diabetes, high cholesterol, or alcohol consumption. Unlike traditional
        ultrasound, fatty liver quantification provides precise numerical values
        that help doctors understand the severity of fat accumulation and
        monitor changes over time.

        The procedure is painless, quick, and highly reliable, making it an
        essential tool for early diagnosis and treatment planning. At Aura
        Diagnostics, we use state-of-the-art technology to ensure accurate and
        detailed fatty liver evaluation for better long-term health management.
