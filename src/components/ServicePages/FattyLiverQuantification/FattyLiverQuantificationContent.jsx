            provides a reliable, non-invasive method to understand liver health
            and quantify the degree of fat accumulation. This advanced imaging
            helps patients receive timely medical support and take corrective
            steps based on accurate diagnostic results.

            A liver fat measurement in Girinagar is recommended for individuals
            experiencing symptoms like abdominal discomfort, fatigue, unintended
            weight changes, or those with risk factors such as diabetes, high
            cholesterol, obesity, thyroid disorders, or alcohol consumption. The
            test offers detailed insights that cannot be obtained through a
            regular ultrasound alone, making it a preferred solution for precise

          <h2>What Is a Fatty Liver Quantification Scan?</h2>
          <p>
            A fatty liver quantification scan measures the percentage of fat
            stored within liver cells. Unlike conventional imaging, this
            technique provides a numerical value that indicates the exact
            severity of fat deposition. Patients can easily track improvements
            or worsening of the condition over time. The rising demand for{" "}
