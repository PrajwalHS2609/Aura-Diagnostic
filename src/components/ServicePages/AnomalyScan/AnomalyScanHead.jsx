      <p id="expect">
        An Anomaly Scan, also known as the mid-pregnancy or level-2 ultrasound,
        is a detailed examination performed between 18 to 22 weeks of pregnancy
        to assess the baby’s overall development. This scan carefully evaluates
        the baby’s organs, brain, heart, spine, limbs, kidneys, and facial
        structures to detect any structural abnormalities early. It also checks
        the placenta position, amniotic fluid levels, and blood flow to ensure a
        healthy pregnancy environment. The anomaly scan provides crucial
        information for your obstetrician to plan appropriate care and support.
        At Aura Diagnostics, our advanced imaging technology and expert
        radiologists ensure accurate, clear, and reassuring results for every
        expecting mother.
