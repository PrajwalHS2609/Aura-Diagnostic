      <h2>What to Expect During a Anomaly Scans?</h2>
      <p>
        During an Anomaly Scan at Aura Diagnostics, you can expect a detailed,
        reassuring, and highly informative mid-pregnancy evaluation. The session
        usually begins with the sonographer reviewing your medical history,
        previous scan reports, and any concerns you may have. You will then be
        asked to lie comfortably on the ultrasound table while a warm gel is
        applied to your abdomen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using advanced high-resolution ultrasound technology, the sonographer
        gently moves the probe across your belly to capture detailed images of
        your baby. The anomaly scan examines the baby’s vital organs—including
        the brain, heart, kidneys, stomach, spine, limbs, and facial features—to
        detect any structural abnormalities. The sonographer also measures fetal
        growth, assesses the placenta’s position, checks amniotic fluid levels,
        and evaluates blood flow between the mother and baby.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scan usually takes 30–45 minutes because each part of the baby’s
        anatomy is examined thoroughly. You may see your baby moving,
        stretching, or turning onscreen, making the experience both clinical and
        emotionally special.
      </p>
      <p>
        The procedure is completely safe and painless. After the scan, a
        detailed report is prepared by our experienced radiologists to support
        your doctor in ensuring the healthiest pregnancy journey possible.
