        During a Uterine Biophysical Profile (UBP) at Aura Diagnostics, you can
        expect a detailed and carefully guided ultrasound evaluation aimed at
        assessing the overall health and functionality of your uterus. When you
        arrive, our specialist will explain the purpose of the scan, its
        benefits, and what parameters will be assessed. This ensures you feel
        fully informed and comfortable before the procedure begins.

        The scan is usually performed transvaginally for optimal clarity. During
        the procedure, the sonographer will examine the endometrial lining,
        measuring its thickness, texture, and vascularity (blood flow). These
        indicators help evaluate whether the uterus is receptive and prepared
        for embryo implantation. The scan also assesses uterine contractions,
        which can affect embryo placement, and checks for structural
        abnormalities such as fibroids, uterine septum, polyps, or adenomyosis.

        Doppler imaging may be used to study blood flow patterns to the uterus
        and endometrium, providing deeper insight into uterine health. The
        procedure is painless, though mild pressure may be felt, and typically
        takes 10–20 minutes. After the scan, your doctor will review the
        findings with you and discuss how they may guide fertility treatments
        like IVF, IUI, or timed conception. Aura Diagnostics ensures clarity,
        precision, and compassionate care throughout the entire process.
