      <h2>What is a Uterine Biophysical Profile?</h2>
      <p id="expect">
        A Uterine Biophysical Profile (UBP) is an advanced ultrasound assessment
        used to evaluate the health, structure, and function of the uterus,
        especially in women undergoing fertility evaluation or treatment. This
        scan measures key parameters such as endometrial thickness, texture,
        blood flow patterns, and uterine contractions. It helps determine
        whether the uterine environment is suitable for embryo implantation and
        early pregnancy support. A UBP also assesses uterine abnormalities like
        fibroids, polyps, or structural variants that may impact fertility. At
        Aura Diagnostics, a Uterine Biophysical Profile provides detailed
        insights that guide fertility specialists in planning effective
        treatments such as IVF, IUI, or natural conception monitoring.
