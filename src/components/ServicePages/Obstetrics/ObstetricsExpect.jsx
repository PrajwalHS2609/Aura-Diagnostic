      <h2>What to Expect During a Obstetrics?</h2>
      <p>
        During an obstetrics visit at Aura Diagnostics, you can expect a
        comprehensive and reassuring experience designed to support both
        maternal and fetal health. The visit typically begins with a detailed
        discussion about your medical history, current symptoms, and overall
        pregnancy progress. Our specialists will check vital signs, monitor
        weight, and assess blood pressure to ensure the mother’s well-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may undergo essential diagnostic tests such as blood work, urine
        analysis, and ultrasound scans to monitor fetal development, heartbeat,
        and growth patterns. Depending on the stage of pregnancy, your
        obstetrician may evaluate fetal movements, amniotic fluid levels, and
        the position of the baby. If you are in a high-risk category, additional
        screenings or frequent monitoring may be recommended.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your doctor will also provide guidance on nutrition, exercise,
        medication safety, and lifestyle adjustments to support a healthy
        pregnancy. Each visit concludes with time for you to ask questions and
        discuss any concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, an obstetrics visit ensures continuous care, early detection of
        complications, and complete support throughout your pregnancy journey.
