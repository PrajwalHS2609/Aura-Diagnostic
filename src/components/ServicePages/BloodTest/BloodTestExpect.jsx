      <h2>What to Expect During a Blood Test?</h2>
      <p>
        During a blood test, the process is quick, safe, and usually completed
        within a few minutes. A trained phlebotomist will first verify your
        details and make sure you are comfortable. The inside of your elbow or
        the back of your hand is typically chosen as the collection site. The
        area is cleaned thoroughly, and a small needle is used to draw the
        required amount of blood. You may feel a slight pinch, but the
        discomfort is minimal and temporary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once collected, the sample is carefully labeled and sent to the
        laboratory for analysis. After the procedure, a cotton swab or small
        bandage is applied to prevent minor bleeding. Most people can resume
        normal activities immediately after the test.
