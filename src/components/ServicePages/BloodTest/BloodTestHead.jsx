      <p id="expect">
        A blood test is a medical investigation that analyzes a small sample of
        your blood to evaluate your overall health and detect a wide range of
        conditions. It helps measure vital components such as red and white
        blood cells, hemoglobin, cholesterol, sugars, hormones, enzymes, and
        more. Doctors use blood tests to diagnose illnesses, monitor ongoing
        treatments, assess organ function, check for infections, and track
        nutritional or metabolic imbalances. Whether it’s a routine health check
        or a specific diagnostic need, blood tests provide reliable insights
        that guide accurate medical decisions and support early detection for
        better health outcomes.
