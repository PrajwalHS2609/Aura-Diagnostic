      <h2>What to Expect During a Fetal Echo?</h2>
      <p>
        During a Fetal Echo at Aura Diagnostics, you can expect a detailed and
        highly focused evaluation of your baby’s heart. The appointment begins
        with a brief discussion about your pregnancy history, any previous scan
        findings, and the reason your doctor recommended a fetal
        echocardiography. You will then be asked to lie comfortably on the
        ultrasound table while a warm gel is gently applied to your abdomen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using specialized cardiac ultrasound equipment, the fetal cardiologist
        or expert sonographer slowly moves the probe across your belly to
        capture clear images of your baby’s heart. The scan examines the heart’s
        chambers, valves, major blood vessels, heartbeat rhythm, and overall
        functioning. You may see your baby’s tiny heart beating on the screen as
        the specialist studies blood flow patterns and structural details using
        advanced Doppler imaging.
      </p>
      <p>
        The procedure is entirely safe, non-invasive, and typically takes 30–45
        minutes, depending on your baby’s position. Sometimes, you may be asked
        to change positions or wait a few minutes if the baby is not in an ideal
        posture for viewing.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Aura Diagnostics, every fetal echo is conducted with precision, care,
        and clear communication—ensuring accurate assessment and complete
        reassurance for expecting parents.
