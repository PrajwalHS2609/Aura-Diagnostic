      <h2>What is a Fetal Echo?</h2>
      <p id="expect">
        A Fetal Echo (Fetal Echocardiography) is a specialized ultrasound used
        to examine the structure and function of a baby’s heart during
        pregnancy. Typically performed between 18 to 24 weeks, this scan
        provides highly detailed images of the fetal heart, including its
        chambers, valves, major blood vessels, and rhythm. It helps detect
        congenital heart defects, assess blood flow, and evaluate how well the
        heart is functioning before birth.
      </p>
      <p>
        A fetal echo is recommended for high-risk pregnancies, family history of
        heart conditions, abnormal NT scans, or when the doctor needs a closer
        look at fetal cardiac health. At Aura Diagnostics, fetal echo scans are
        performed using advanced cardiac imaging technology for accurate and
        early diagnosis.
