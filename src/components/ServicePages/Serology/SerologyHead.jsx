      <p id="expect">
        A Serology Blood Test is a diagnostic test that examines your blood
        sample to identify antibodies and antigens related to infections and
        immune responses. This test helps detect conditions such as viral
        infections, bacterial infections, autoimmune disorders, and immune
        system abnormalities. Serology tests play a vital role in diagnosing
        illnesses like dengue, HIV, hepatitis, typhoid, and various other
        infectious diseases. By studying how your immune system responds to
        pathogens, doctors can understand whether you have a current infection,
        a past infection, or immunity. At Aura Diagnostics, serology testing
        supports accurate diagnosis and timely medical treatment.
