                Follicular Study Scan in Girinagar — Key to Tracking Ovulation
              </h2>
              <p>
                One of the most widely recommended tests is the follicular study
                scan in Girinagar, which tracks the growth and maturity of
                ovarian follicles. These follicles release eggs during
                ovulation. Monitoring them through multiple ultrasound sessions
                helps assess:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li> Follicle size</li>
                <li> Ovulation timing</li>
                <li> Endometrial thickness</li>
                <li> Chances of natural conception</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This structured process also supports fertility treatments such
                as IUI and IVF. For patients searching for “fertility scan near
                me Girinagar,” follicular tracking is often the most important
                diagnostic tool in planning pregnancy.

              <p>
                A Doppler fertility scan in Girinagar adds more depth to
