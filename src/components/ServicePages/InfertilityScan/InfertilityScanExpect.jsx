      <h2>What to Expect During a Infertility Scans?</h2>
      <p>
        During an infertility scan at Aura Diagnostics, you can expect a smooth,
        detailed, and comfortable evaluation of your reproductive health. For
        women, the process usually begins with a transabdominal ultrasound,
        where a probe is placed over the lower abdomen to get an overview of the
        uterus and ovaries. In many cases, a transvaginal scan is also
        recommended for a clearer, more precise view of follicle development,
        endometrial thickness, uterine lining, and any abnormalities such as
        cysts, fibroids, or signs of PCOS. The scan is safe, minimally invasive,
        and typically takes 15–20 minutes.

        If both partners are being evaluated, a scrotal ultrasound may be
        performed for men to examine testicular structure, blood flow, and any
        issues that may affect fertility. Throughout the process, the
        sonographer or radiologist explains each step, ensuring you remain
        relaxed and informed. The results help your fertility specialist
        understand hormonal cycles, ovulation patterns, and potential obstacles
        to conception. Aura Diagnostics focuses on accuracy, privacy, and
        compassionate care, supporting you through every stage of your fertility
        journey.
