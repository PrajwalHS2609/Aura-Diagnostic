        An infertility scan is a specialized ultrasound used to assess
        reproductive health in women and men who are facing difficulty
        conceiving. It helps doctors evaluate the uterus, ovaries, and
        endometrium in women, identifying conditions like fibroids, cysts, PCOS,
        or ovulation-related issues. In men, scrotal ultrasound may be advised
        to check structural or vascular concerns. Infertility scans provide
        real-time imaging, allowing specialists to diagnose underlying problems
        early and recommend the right treatment plan. At Aura Diagnostics,
        infertility scans are performed using advanced technology to ensure
        accurate results, helping couples move closer to a healthy and
        successful conception journey.
