      <h2>What to Expect During a Renal Doppler?</h2>
      <p>
        {" "}
        During a Renal Doppler at Aura Diagnostics, you can expect a
        comfortable, non-invasive, and detailed evaluation of the blood flow to
        your kidneys. When you arrive, our specialist will explain the purpose
        of the test and guide you through the steps to ensure you feel at ease.
        You may be asked to lie on your back or side on the examination table,
        depending on the angle required for optimal imaging.

        A warm gel will be applied to your abdomen and flank area to help the
        ultrasound waves travel clearly. Using a handheld transducer, the
        sonographer will gently glide the device over your abdominal region to
        capture real-time images of your kidneys and renal blood vessels.
        Doppler technology will create waveforms and velocity measurements,
        helping detect any narrowing, blockages, or abnormal blood flow
        patterns.
      </p>

        You may hear the Doppler sound, which reflects the movement of blood
        through the renal arteries and veins. The procedure typically lasts
        20–30 minutes and is painless, though mild pressure may be applied. Once
        completed, the gel will be cleaned off, and you can resume normal
        activities immediately. Your doctor will later review the results to
        assess kidney function and guide appropriate treatment or further
        testing. Aura Diagnostics ensures accuracy, clarity, and compassionate
        care throughout the process.
