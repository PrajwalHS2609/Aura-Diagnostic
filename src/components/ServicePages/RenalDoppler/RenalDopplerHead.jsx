      <h2>What is a Renal Doppler?</h2>
      <p id="expect">
        A Renal Doppler is a specialized ultrasound test used to evaluate the
        blood flow to and from the kidneys. This non-invasive scan uses Doppler
        technology to assess the renal arteries and veins, helping detect
        narrowing (stenosis), blockages, or other vascular abnormalities that
        may affect kidney function. It is commonly recommended for patients with
        hypertension, unexplained kidney problems, or suspected renal artery
        stenosis. The scan provides real-time information about blood flow
        patterns, kidney size, and structure. At Aura Diagnostics, a Renal
        Doppler offers accurate assessment, early diagnosis, and valuable
        guidance for managing kidney-related health conditions effectively.
