      <h2>What is a Whole Body Doppler?</h2>
      <p id="expect">
        A Whole Body Doppler is a comprehensive vascular ultrasound assessment
        that evaluates blood flow throughout the major arteries and veins in the
        entire body. This non-invasive scan uses Doppler technology to measure
        circulation, detect blockages, identify narrowing of vessels, and assess
        the overall health of the vascular system. It is especially beneficial
        for individuals with diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, or
        symptoms of peripheral artery disease. The scan helps detect early signs
        of stroke risk, deep vein thrombosis, or poor circulation. At Aura
        Diagnostics, a Whole Body Doppler provides detailed insights that
        support early diagnosis, preventive care, and effective treatment
        planning.
