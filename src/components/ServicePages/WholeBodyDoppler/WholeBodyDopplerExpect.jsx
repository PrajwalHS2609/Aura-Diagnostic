      <h2>What to Expect During a Whole Body Doppler?</h2>
      <p>
        {" "}
        During a Whole Body Doppler at Aura Diagnostics, you can expect a
        thorough, painless, and well-structured evaluation of your entire
        vascular system. When you arrive, our experienced technician will
        explain the process and ensure you feel relaxed and informed. You will
        be asked to lie comfortably on an examination table, and different parts
        of your body—such as the neck, arms, abdomen, and legs—will be scanned
        one by one.
      </p>
      <p>
        A warm, water-based gel will be applied to each area to help the
        ultrasound waves pass smoothly. Using a handheld transducer, the
        sonographer will capture real-time images and Doppler waveforms from
        major arteries and veins. You may hear whooshing sounds throughout the
        scan—these represent blood flow and are completely normal. The scan
        checks for blockages, narrowing, abnormal blood flow patterns, and early
        signs of vascular disease.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because this is a full-body evaluation, the procedure may take 45–90
        minutes depending on your health condition and the level of detail
        required. The scan is non-invasive, requires no recovery time, and you
        can return to your routine immediately afterward. Once complete, your
        doctor will review the findings and discuss any areas of concern along
        with recommendations for further evaluation or treatment. Aura
        Diagnostics ensures precision, comfort, and comprehensive care during
        every Whole Body Doppler exam.
