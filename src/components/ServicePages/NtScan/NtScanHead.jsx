          An NT Scan (Nuchal Translucency Scan) is an essential early pregnancy
          ultrasound performed between 11 to 14 weeks to assess the baby’s risk
          of chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome, Edward syndrome,
          and Patau syndrome. The scan measures the fluid-filled space at the
          back of the baby’s neck, known as the nuchal translucency. A thicker
          measurement may indicate a higher risk and may require further
          testing.
        </p>

        <p>
          The NT scan also helps evaluate the baby’s heartbeat, early anatomical
          development, gestational age, and overall wellbeing. At Aura
          Diagnostics, NT scans are conducted using high-resolution ultrasound
          technology to ensure precise measurements, accurate assessments, and
          complete reassurance for expectant parents.
