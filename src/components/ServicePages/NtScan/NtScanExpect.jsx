      <h2>What to Expect During a NT Scans?</h2>
      <p>
        During an NT Scan at Aura Diagnostics, you can expect a careful,
        detailed, and reassuring early pregnancy evaluation. The procedure
        typically starts with the sonographer reviewing your medical history and
        previous scan reports, followed by guiding you to lie comfortably on the
        ultrasound table. A warm gel is then applied to your abdomen to help
        capture clear images.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using a high-resolution ultrasound probe, the sonographer examines your
        baby’s position, heartbeat, and early anatomical development. The main
        purpose of the NT scan is to measure the nuchal translucency—the
        fluid-filled space at the back of your baby’s neck. This measurement
        helps assess the risk of chromosomal conditions such as Down syndrome,
        Edward syndrome, and Patau syndrome.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may be asked to change positions slightly so the baby is in an
        optimal posture for accurate measurement. The scan is completely safe,
        non-invasive, and typically takes 15–25 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along with the nuchal measurement, the sonographer may also check the
        baby’s nasal bone, limb formation, and blood flow patterns, offering
        further reassurance about fetal health. At Aura Diagnostics, every NT
        scan is conducted with utmost precision, compassion, and clear
        communication to help expectant parents feel confident and informed.
