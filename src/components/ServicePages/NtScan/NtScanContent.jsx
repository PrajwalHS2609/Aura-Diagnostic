            A Nuchal Translucency scan in Girinagar is a specialized ultrasound
            test used to assess the risk of certain chromosomal abnormalities
            and developmental conditions in early pregnancy.

          <h2>What Is a Nuchal Translucency (NT) Scan?</h2>
          <p>
            A Nuchal Translucency scan measures the clear fluid-filled space at
            the back of the baby’s neck. This measurement, when combined with
            maternal age and blood test markers, helps assess the likelihood of
            chromosomal conditions such as Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), Trisomy
            18, and Trisomy 13.

              <h2>How the Prenatal NT Scan in Girinagar Is Performed</h2>
              <p>
                A prenatal NT scan in Girinagar is typically conducted using
                abdominal ultrasound. In some cases, depending on fetal position
                and visibility, a transvaginal ultrasound may be recommended for
                improved accuracy.
              </p>
              <h3>What Happens During the Scan:</h3>
             <ul>
                 <li> The fetus is carefully positioned on the imaging screen</li>
              <li> The fluid space behind the fetal neck is measured</li>
              <li>
                Fetal heartbeat, nasal bone, and overall development are
                observed
              </li>
              <li> The scan is completed within 20–30 minutes</li>
             </ul>
              <p>
                The procedure is painless and does not require special
                preparation.
