      <h2>What to Expect During a 3D & 4D Fetal Scans?</h2>
      <p>
        During a 3D & 4D fetal scan at Aura Diagnostics, you can expect a warm,
        exciting, and highly detailed viewing experience of your baby in the
        womb. The process begins with a brief discussion about your pregnancy
        stage, previous scans, and any concerns you may have. You will then be
        asked to lie comfortably on the ultrasound table while a warm gel is
        applied to your abdomen to help capture clear images.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using advanced high-resolution ultrasound technology, the sonographer
        slowly moves the transducer over your belly to create three-dimensional
        images and real-time videos of your baby. You may get to see your baby’s
        facial expressions, yawning, kicking, stretching, or even smiling,
        depending on the fetal position. The experience is often emotional and
        memorable for parents.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scan is completely safe, non-invasive, and painless. It typically
        lasts 20–40 minutes, depending on your baby’s position and cooperation.
        Sometimes, you may be asked to change positions or gently tap your belly
        to help the baby move for clearer visuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Aura Diagnostics, every 3D & 4D scan is performed with precision and
        care, giving you beautifully detailed images while ensuring medically
        accurate fetal assessment.
