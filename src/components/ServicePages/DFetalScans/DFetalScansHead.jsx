      <h2>What is a 3D & 4D Fetal Scans?</h2>
      <p id="expect">
        A 3D & 4D Fetal Scan is an advanced pregnancy ultrasound that provides
        lifelike images and real-time videos of your baby inside the womb. A 3D
        scan captures detailed three-dimensional images, helping you see your
        baby’s facial features, hands, feet, and overall structure with greater
        clarity. A 4D scan adds movement to these images, allowing you to watch
        your baby yawn, stretch, smile, or move in real time.
      </p>
      <p>
        These scans also assist doctors in evaluating fetal growth, development,
        and detecting certain abnormalities more accurately. At Aura
        Diagnostics, our high-resolution imaging technology ensures safe,
        memorable, and medically insightful 3D & 4D scanning experiences for
        expecting parents.
