      <p id="expect">
        A 3D Pelvis scan is an advanced ultrasound imaging technique used to
        create three-dimensional views of the pelvic region for clearer and more
        detailed evaluation. This scan helps doctors visualize the uterus,
        ovaries, fallopian tubes, bladder, and surrounding structures with
        enhanced accuracy compared to traditional 2D ultrasound. A 3D Pelvis
        scan is commonly recommended for assessing pelvic pain, fibroids,
        ovarian cysts, infertility concerns, congenital abnormalities, and
        structural changes. It also helps in planning treatments and monitoring
        progress. At diagnostic centers, this scan is performed using
        high-resolution ultrasound technology to provide precise images,
        enabling specialists to detect conditions earlier and offer more
        effective, personalized care.
