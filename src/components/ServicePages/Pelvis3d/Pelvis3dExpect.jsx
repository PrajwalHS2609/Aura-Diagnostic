      <h2>What to Expect During a 3D Pelvis?</h2>

      <p>
        During a 3D Pelvis scan, you can expect a comfortable and
        straightforward procedure designed to give your doctor a detailed view
        of your pelvic organs. The scan usually begins with a brief discussion
        about your symptoms, medical history, and the purpose of the test. You
        may be asked to drink water beforehand so your bladder is partially
        full, which helps improve clarity for certain pelvic structures.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the scan begins, a trained sonographer will apply a warm gel to your
        lower abdomen to ensure smooth movement of the ultrasound probe and
        better image capture. Using advanced 3D ultrasound technology, the probe
        creates high-resolution, three-dimensional images of your uterus,
        ovaries, fallopian tubes, bladder, and surrounding tissues. In some
        cases, a transvaginal scan may also be recommended for more precise
        imaging.
      </p>
      <p>
        The process is painless, non-invasive, and typically takes around 20–30
        minutes. Throughout the scan, the technician will guide you and ensure
        your comfort. Once completed, the detailed 3D images are reviewed by a
        radiologist, helping your doctor diagnose conditions like fibroids,
        cysts, infertility issues, or structural abnormalities with greater
        accuracy.
