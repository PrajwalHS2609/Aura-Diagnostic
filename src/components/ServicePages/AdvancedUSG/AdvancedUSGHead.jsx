      <p>
        {" "}
        An Advanced USG (Ultrasound Sonography) is a high-precision imaging
        technique used to capture detailed visuals of internal organs, tissues,
        and fetal development. Unlike standard ultrasound, Advanced USG uses
        enhanced technology, high-resolution probes, and specialized imaging
        modes to provide clearer, more accurate diagnostic information. It is
        commonly used for pregnancy monitoring, abdominal scans, pelvic
        evaluations, vascular studies, and organ assessments. This advanced
        procedure helps doctors detect abnormalities earlier, plan treatments
        more effectively, and ensure comprehensive health evaluation. At Aura
        Diagnostics, Advanced USG is performed by experienced radiologists using
        state-of-the-art equipment to ensure accuracy, safety, and reliable
        results for every patient.
