      <h2>What to Expect During a Advanced USG?</h2>
      <p>
        During an Advanced USG, you can expect a smooth, comfortable, and highly
        precise diagnostic experience. The procedure begins with the radiologist
        or sonographer explaining the purpose of the scan and guiding you to lie
        on the examination table. A warm, water-based gel is applied to the skin
        to ensure proper contact and clearer imaging. Using a high-resolution
        ultrasound probe, the specialist gently moves the device over the
        targeted area to capture detailed internal images.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the scan, you may be asked to change positions, hold your
        breath for a few seconds, or remain still to obtain the best possible
        visuals. Advanced USG takes advantage of enhanced imaging technology,
        allowing radiologists to examine organs, tissues, blood flow, or fetal
        development with exceptional clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The procedure is non-invasive, painless, and completely safe. It
        typically lasts between 20 to 45 minutes depending on the area being
        scanned. After the scan, the gel is wiped off, and you can resume your
        normal routine immediately. At Aura Diagnostics, results are carefully
        analyzed by expert radiologists to ensure accurate diagnosis and timely
        report delivery.
