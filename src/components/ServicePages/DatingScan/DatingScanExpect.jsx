      <h2>What to Expect During a Dating Scans?</h2>
      <p>
        During a Dating Scan at Aura Diagnostics, you can expect a warm,
        reassuring, and detailed early pregnancy assessment. The process
        typically begins with a brief discussion with your sonographer about
        your last menstrual cycle, medical history, and any symptoms you’ve
        experienced so far. You will then be guided to lie comfortably on the
        ultrasound table.
      </p>
      <p>
        A warm gel is applied to your lower abdomen, and the sonographer gently
        moves the transducer to capture clear images of your developing baby. In
        early pregnancy, if abdominal imaging is not clear enough, a
        transvaginal scan may be recommended for more accurate visuals. This
        method is safe, minimally invasive, and provides high-resolution details
        of the embryo.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the scan, you may see the tiny gestational sac, fetal pole, and
        the baby’s heartbeat for the first time. The sonographer will measure
        the crown–rump length (CRL) to determine your baby’s gestational age and
        calculate the estimated due date.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire procedure takes about 10–20 minutes and is completely
        painless. At Aura Diagnostics, every Dating Scan is conducted with care,
        accuracy, and a focus on making the experience memorable for expecting
        parents.
