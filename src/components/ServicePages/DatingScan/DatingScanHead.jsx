      <h2>What is a Dating Scans?</h2>
      <p id="expect">
        A Dating Scan is an early pregnancy ultrasound performed to determine
        the gestational age of the baby and calculate the expected due date.
        Typically done between 6 to 12 weeks of pregnancy, this scan confirms
        the presence of a fetal heartbeat, checks the number of embryos, and
        assesses the baby’s early development. It also helps identify the
        location of the pregnancy to rule out concerns such as ectopic
        pregnancy. Dating scans provide reassurance to expecting parents and
        offer essential medical information for proper pregnancy care. At Aura
        Diagnostics, we use advanced ultrasound technology to deliver accurate
        and detailed results.
