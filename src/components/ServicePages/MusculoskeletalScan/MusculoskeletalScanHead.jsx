      <h2>What is a Musculoskeletal Scans?</h2>
      <p id="expect">
        A Musculoskeletal (MSK) Scan is a specialized ultrasound used to examine
        the muscles, tendons, ligaments, joints, and soft tissues of the body.
        It helps diagnose a wide range of conditions such as sprains, tendon
        tears, muscle injuries, inflammation, arthritis, and joint
        abnormalities. Unlike X-rays, an MSK scan provides real-time dynamic
        imaging, allowing doctors to assess movement, detect subtle injuries,
        and evaluate blood flow to affected areas. It is safe, painless, and
        radiation-free, making it suitable for patients of all ages. At Aura
        Diagnostics, Musculoskeletal Scans are performed using advanced
        ultrasound technology for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment
        planning.
