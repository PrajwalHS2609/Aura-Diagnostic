      <h2>What to Expect During a Musculoskeletal Scans?</h2>
      <p>
        During a Musculoskeletal (MSK) Scan at Aura Diagnostics, you can expect
        a smooth, comfortable, and highly detailed evaluation of your joints,
        muscles, ligaments, or tendons. The procedure begins with a brief
        discussion where the radiologist or sonographer asks about your
        symptoms, injury history, and any discomfort you may be experiencing.
        You will then be positioned comfortably on the examination table,
        depending on the body part being scanned.

        A warm, water-based gel is applied to the area to ensure clear and
        accurate imaging. Using a high-resolution ultrasound probe, the
        specialist gently moves the transducer over the targeted region,
        capturing real-time visuals of your musculoskeletal structures. Unlike
        static imaging methods, MSK scans allow dynamic assessment—you may be
        asked to move the joint or muscle gently so the radiologist can observe
        how the tissues behave during motion.
      </p>

        The scan is completely painless and usually takes 20–30 minutes.
        Throughout the process, the sonographer explains what they are
        evaluating and ensures you remain relaxed. After the scan, the gel is
        wiped off, and you can resume normal activities immediately. At Aura
        Diagnostics, expert radiologists carefully analyze the imaging to
        provide an accurate diagnosis and help guide effective treatment
        options.
