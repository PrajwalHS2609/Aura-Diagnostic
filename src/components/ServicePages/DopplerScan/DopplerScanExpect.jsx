      <h2>What to Expect During a Doppler Scans?</h2>
      <p>
        During a Doppler scan at Aura Diagnostics, you can expect a smooth,
        comfortable, and non-invasive procedure performed by experienced
        sonographers. The scan typically begins with you lying down on an
        examination table while a clear, water-based gel is applied to the
        targeted area to help transmit sound waves effectively. The sonographer
        will then move a handheld device called a transducer over the area to
        capture real-time images and blood flow patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the device works, you may hear pulsating or whooshing sounds—these
        represent the movement of blood through your vessels and are completely
        normal. The entire procedure usually takes between 20 to 40 minutes,
        depending on the region being examined.
      </p>
      <p>
        For pregnant women, the Doppler scan focuses on assessing blood flow in
        the umbilical cord, placenta, and fetal vessels, ensuring the baby's
        growth and well-being. For non-pregnancy cases, it evaluates circulation
        in the limbs, neck, or abdominal vessels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the scan is complete, the gel is wiped off, and you can resume your
        normal activities immediately. At Aura Diagnostics, results are reviewed
        by skilled radiologists to ensure accurate and timely reporting.
