      <h2>What is a Doppler Scans?</h2>
      <p id="expect">
        A Doppler scan is a specialized ultrasound technique used to measure the
        flow of blood through vessels, including major arteries and veins.
        Unlike a regular ultrasound that only captures images, a Doppler scan
        evaluates how well blood is circulating within the body. It is widely
        used during pregnancy to check blood flow between the mother and baby,
        ensuring the fetus receives enough oxygen and nutrients. Doppler scans
        also help diagnose conditions like blocked arteries, varicose veins, or
        reduced blood supply to organs. At Aura Diagnostics, Doppler scans are
        performed using advanced technology for accurate, safe, and non-invasive
        assessment.
